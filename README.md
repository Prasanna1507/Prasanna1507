# 👋 Hi, I'm Naga Lakshmi Prasanna Gottipati  

## 💫 About Me:
🔭 I’m currently working on building **data engineering and AI-driven analytics pipelines** using **Azure, Snowflake, and Python** to enable scalable data processing and intelligent decision systems.  

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on **data engineering**, **AI automation**, and **end-to-end cloud pipeline** projects that integrate real-time analytics with machine learning.  

🤝 I’m looking for help with **MLOps**, **data pipeline orchestration**, and **AI model deployment** in cloud environments.  

🌱 I’m currently learning **Microsoft Fabric**, **Databricks**, and **Generative AI** applications in data transformation.  

💬 Ask me about **ETL design**, **data modeling**, **AI integration in analytics**, **Snowflake performance tuning**, and **Power BI automation**.  

⚡ Fun fact: I love optimizing data pipelines for speed and efficiency — and when I’m not engineering data, I’m exploring new AI tools and sketching! 🎨
